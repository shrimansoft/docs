<p>We usually tell the story to ourselves, which makes us feel special; in the story in which everyone loves us, I am the one, To whom everyone should care about.</p>
<p class="align-center"><em>Things we see will change if we tell ourselves a different story. </em></p>
<p>We have justification for all the moves we have made. Sometimes we create<strong> assumptions about ourselves ( which need not be true) </strong> to justify our desires and actions.</p>
<p class="align-center"><em>Things we see will change if we tell ourselves a different story. </em></p>
<p>These<strong> assumptions</strong> justify ourselves so we would be the <strong>good person in our story</strong>. These stories are the explanation of what we did. Sometimes they are far from reality. Since it's not true, one day when we realize that we are not who we thought, it puts us on the ground; we know this situation is an "existential crisis." It is when thoughts and observations collide with the need to update our beliefs.</p>
<p class="align-center"><em>Things we see will change if we tell ourselves a different story. </em></p>
<p>These assumptions we made to justify ourselves. Through this,<strong> we form our personality</strong>. Since we want to be good in that story { we told ourselves}. <strong>We have to behave according to the assumptions we have made</strong>. There are some examples of these assumptions.</p>
<ol>
<li>I love you</li>
<li>I hate you</li>
<li>I am dumb</li>
<li>We are friends</li>
<li>I have a high temper</li>
<li>Yes, but I am like that</li>
<li>I am introvert</li>
<li>I don't go and talk first</li>
</ol>
<p>and many more...</p>
<p class="align-center"><em>Things we see will change if we tell ourselves a different story. </em></p>
<p>So what do we do?</p>
<p>So what story should I tell ourselves?</p>
<p>I don't know why we even tell a story to ourselves. </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="align-center"><em>Why should we have to tell a story to ourselves in the first place? </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want you to think. <strong>Why did we tell stories to ourselves why?</strong> </p>
